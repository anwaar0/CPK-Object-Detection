# Cross-Pollination-of-Knowledge-for-Object-Detection-in-Domain-Adaptation-for-Industrial-Automation
Artificial Intelligence (AI) transforms industries by automating activities and
enhancing efficiency using real-time Object Detection (OD) applications. The OD
with modern computer vision methods empowers systems to automate processes,
analyze challenging visual data, and make data-driven choices, eventually boosting
productivity. Domain adaptation (DA) for OD has recently depicted ample
attention due to its competence in identifying target objects with no annotations.
Recently, new methodologies integrating traditional cross-disciplinary domain
modeling with advanced deep learning techniques are increasingly recognized as
crucial for solving complex AI and real-time problems. This work proposes a simple
but effective inter-disciplinary Cross-Pollination of knowledge (CPK) strategy
for source and target domains in Domain Adaptation. The CPK originates from
the Botany domain; it fuses the target samples in the source samples at the input
level, and the fusion of a random and unique number of target samples supports
the detector in feature alignment and generalization with the source domain. This
work also introduced the newly constructed digit recognition dataset (Planeat),
which comprises 231 images. For the fair comparison, this study employs an
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) method that takes advantage of unsupervision
to train the target and source domains synchronously. UDA method
uses target data, extracts the high-confidence region, crop and applies augmentation
techniques to these regions, and adapts UDA for OD. The proposed CPK
performs efficiently through extensive experiments in five different datasets under cross-weather, cross-camera, and synthetic-to-real cases, outperforming the existing UDA results by the margin of 10.9% of mean Average Precision (mAP).
